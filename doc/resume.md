## 1–2 sentence description

**Listit** is a keyboard-driven productivity web app for managing items and bookmarks with an opinionated focus model (“Today” vs “Back Burner”). Built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **Convex** for **authentication** and **real-time data sync**, plus fast search and responsive UI.

## Resume bullet points (impact-focused)

- **Built a Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript app** with App Router layouts, authenticated app shell, onboarding flow, and responsive UI using Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- **Implemented real-time CRUD workflows on Convex** (queries/mutations + schema design) for items, bookmarks, collections, and user settings with instant UI updates.
- **Designed a keyboard-first UX** with vim-style navigation and power-user shortcuts for creating, searching, editing, and triaging items/bookmarks.
- **Shipped a bookmark organization system** with collections, rich metadata fields (title/description/favicon/summary/tags/read state), and search across stored content.
- **Created an opinionated focus system (“Today” / “Back Burner”)** to support rapid capture, intentional prioritization, and archiving to prevent list clutter.
- **Integrated secure authentication via Convex Auth** and wired user-scoped settings (e.g., onboarding preferences) to personalize the experience.
- **Improved developer velocity** with a clean feature-based component structure, reusable UI primitives, and parallel dev workflows (frontend + Convex backend).

## Tech stack (one-liner)

**Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript, Convex (DB + serverless functions + real-time), Convex Auth, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui**
